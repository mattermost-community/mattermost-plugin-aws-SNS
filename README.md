This plugin is used to send alert notifications from [Amazon AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to Mattermost channels via AWS SNS. RDS Event processing is also supported.

Originally developed by [Carlos Tadeu Panato Junior](https://github.com/cpanato/).

## Configuration

### Step 1: Configure plugin in Mattermost

1. Go to **System Console > Plugins > AWS SNS**.

  1. Set the channel to send notifications to, specified in the format `teamname,channelname`. If the specified channel does not exist, the plugin will create the channel for you. If you want to specify more than one channel, you can append them separated by `;` e.g. `teamname,channelname;teamname-2,channelname-2`
      - Note: Must be the team and channel handle used in the URL. For example, in the following URL, set the value to `myteam,mychannel`: https://example.com/myteam/channels/mychannel.

  2. Set authorized users who can accept AWS SNS subscriptions. Must be a comma-separated list of user IDs.
      - Tip: Use the [mattermost user search](https://mattermost.com/pl/cli-mattermost-user-search) CLI command to determine a user ID.
  3. Set the username that this integration is attached to.
  4. Generate a token used for an AWS SNS subscription. Copy this value as you will use it in a later step.

2. Go to **System Console > Plugins > Management** and select **Enable** to enable the AWS SNS plugin.

### Step 2: Configure plugin in Amazon AWS

1. Create an [AWS CloudWatch alarm for your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-createalarm.html).
2. Create an AWS SNS Topic with an HTTPS subscription to [https://your-mattermost-url/plugins/com.mattermost.aws-sns?token=your-mattermost-token?channel=teamname,channelname](), where `your-mattermost-url` refers to your Mattermost URL, and `your-mattermost-token` was generated on a previous step. The `channel` query parameter specifies the channel that should receive the subscription/messages. If no `channel` parameter is passed, the first channel will be used as default. [Follow this documentation](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Server_Documentation/ReferenceManual/Amazon_SNS_Publisher_Configure_AWS_Subscription.htm) for additional configuration options.
3. Switch to the Mattermost channel you configured to receive notifications. 
4. Select **Confirm** to accept the subscription posted to the channel.
5. Configure your AWS CloudWatch Alarms to use the topic you created previously.

You're all set! Alerts should now get posted from AWS CloudWatch to Mattermost.
